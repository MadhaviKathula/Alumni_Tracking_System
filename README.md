**Alumni Tracking System**

Alumni Tracking System is an online-based application that helps to tracking of college graduates. 
The project aims to improve current tracking procedure of college graduate and providing alumni data to college faculties. 
It aims to developing a web portal which will be useful for the college to monitor the alumni and for the alumni to update
their current status about the college activities. The proposal of this system is to provide an optimized solution for collecting
and managing the alumni data. The system will be an all-inone place to handle alumni data, to enable communication
between alumni and the institution and provides great flexible features to keep track of the data.

This is a requirement of Smart India Hackathon 2020, ranked 7th position for my project Alumni Tracking System at the college level.
